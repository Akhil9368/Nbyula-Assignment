# Learning_System

In the following assignment, I have  to done an adaptive learning platform,
leveraging gamification to engage users.

There are two types of user roles in this application:
● Teachers
● Students

A teacher is supposed to add/remove/edit and delete courses. For each course, they
will be able to create one quiz only, based on a set of questions and their respective
answers (Choice-based Questions only). Teachers should also be able to
add/edit/delete questions and answers to a quiz for a course.

A quiz can contain multiple questions,The teacher must set the points (positive integer with max value 10) for each
question that the student must receive by answering the question correctly.
and The Student can see the all question in the quiz after clicking the button start and after completing the quiz student cansee the marks along with how many attempts student do.
